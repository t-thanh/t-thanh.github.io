My name is Tien-Thanh Nguyen - you can call me TT. I'm robotics reseacher, working on all kinds of cool stuffs: Unmanned Vehicles (UAV, UGV, USV, ...), robotic manipulation, perception, and integration. 

I love applying and sharing my knowledge to build things that people can try, test and eventually improve. You can find most of my opensource work in this blog and in my [<b>GITHUB</b>](https://github.com/t-thanh).

I try to read more frequently, and start writing as well. This website could be great way to setup my reading and writing habit. You can join me in [<b>GoodReads</b>](https://www.goodreads.com/t-thanh).

I have great passion for marathon running. Follow me in [<b>Strava</b>](https://www.strava.com/athletes/t-thanh).
